# Early Sepsis Prediction 6 Hours Prior to onset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict whether a patient is likely to develop sepsis within the next six hours. The notebook explores various techniques to build the most accurate predictive model.

# Introduction 
Sepsis is a critical medical condition that occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system responds aggressively to an infection, potentially causing damage to its own tissues and organs. This can lead to long-term health complications and, in severe cases, death.

This project utilizes the MIMIC-IV dataset, which includes extensive clinical data from patients in emergency and intensive care units. The dataset provides a strong foundation for developing models aimed at early sepsis prediction.

# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* XGboost
* Sklearn
* Imblearn
* Fastai
* Skopt
* Joblib

# Installation
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikitlearn imblearn fastai skopt joblib

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting sepsis up to 6 hours before onset, which can enable timely medical intervention. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85%, showing promise for use in clinical decision support systems.
